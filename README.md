# 🧍‍♂️ PW.Teams

**PW.Teams** is a lightweight Unreal Engine 5 module providing team and faction logic for multiplayer and AI-driven gameplay.  
It defines relations between actors such as Ally, Enemy, or Neutral and provides unified helpers for querying or comparing team states.

Originally developed as part of **ProjectW**, this module is designed to be **engine-agnostic**, **dependency-light**, and **fully optional** for other PW systems.
