# 🧍‍♂️ PW.Teams
> ⚠️ **Development Status:**  
> This module is currently being extracted and refactored from **ProjectW**, a private Unreal Engine 5 prototype.  
> While most systems are functional, interfaces and folder structures may still change as the refactor progresses.  
> The goal is to make this a clean, reusable, standalone module for future Unreal projects.  


**PW.Teams** is a lightweight Unreal Engine 5 module providing team and faction logic for multiplayer and AI-driven gameplay.  
It defines relations between actors such as Ally, Enemy, or Neutral and provides unified helpers for querying or comparing team states.

Originally developed as part of **ProjectW**, this module is designed to be **engine-agnostic**, **dependency-light**, and **fully optional** for other PW systems.
